          <h1>What We Do</h1>

          <p>My whole goal is to keep you as relaxed and as comfortable as possible during the laboring process! I am trained in finding ways to help minimize pain and the use of drugs/interventions during labor and birth. I will help you figure out what positions work best for you to help baby move along and relieve your pain, including walking, using the birthing balls, birthing stool, shower or whirlpool tub. I will help you stay focused and as relaxed as possible during contractions so you can power through them like a pro! You will be working hard, and I will do my best to keep your mind, body, and spirit going strong. I offer massage (scalp, neck, back, legs, feet, hands, etc.) to help you relax and focus. If aromatherapy is something that entices you, I have many different scents that I can diffuse to help with focusing and relaxing. I can also provide an audio escape through your favorite music or relaxing white noise such as the ocean or a calming stream. If you want prayer or Scripture repetition, I am more than willing to whisper them in your ear or say them out loud and strong to give you strength. I will be a bridge between you and the birthing center/hospital staff. I will inform them of your wishes and work with them to give you the most enjoyable birthing experience possible! During our meetings we will discuss what works best for you and what you will need or want. Every woman and birth is different.

          <h4>Typical Doula Services Package:</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Initial Meeting (12-20 Weeks):</b> This is at no cost to you! This meeting is just so we can meet, get to know each other, and for you to decide if I am the right person for your birth experience!
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>28-ish Week Meeting:</b> At this get-together, we will discuss your ideal labor and birth, work on your birth plan, and I can answer any other questions or concerns you have. It's also a time to just get to know each other better and to chat about how your pregnancy is going and get excited for the birth! This is a great time for me to meet your spouse, partner, support person, etc. so that they are comfortable with me before I show up for the huge life event that birth is. This meeting is typically pretty long, so plan on picking a time where you have a couple of hours free.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Birth:</b> As soon as you are in labor, I will be in contact with you until your precious babe is born! I will be a support person through the phone until you arrive at your birth center or hospital (unless you're having a home birth). Once you are admitted, I will come and support and help you through your labor, no matter how long it is. I will stay until your baby is born and you are feeling comfortable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>6-ish Week Postpartum Visit:</b> Once you are settled in at home and had a few weeks to process your birth experience and the many emotions that come with being a mother to a new babe, I will come visit you at home to talk about everything, see how your doing, and catch up!
            </li>

              <h3>More Prenatal Meetings:</h3> Are you unsure about labor and birth? Do you want to learn more about the details and ways that you can mentally and physically prepare? For some women, talking more in-depth about the labor process and pinpointing specific pain and stress management techniques is extremely helpful! If you generally process things verbally, an extra meeting or two might be beneficial to prepare the best you can for your upcoming birthing experience.

              <h3>Postpartum Visits:</h3> 
              If you don't have close family around to help during those crucial first weeks at home, a couple of postpartum visits may be a life-saver! Whether you need help cleaning up the house, getting nutritious groceries or a meal, or need to catch up on sleep, I can accommodate your specific needs so you can recover well.
